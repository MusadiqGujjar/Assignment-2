    <h2><ins>Business & Technology</ins></h2>
    <P>
        Business technology is any electronic object or system that helps employees <br>
        accomplish tasks. The technology that employees use includes computers, <br>
        internet systems, printers, mobile devices and software applications that help <br>
        them organize and prioritize work. Business technology can also help divide <br>
        work as well, giving employees different goals to make larger tasks easier. <br>
        Managers can use business technology to look for new hires, arrange <br>
        collaborations with other businesses or assess the company's finance.<br>
    </P>
    <p>

        Whether you're communicating with your team, updating a policy <BR>
        or reviewing old records, technology has a major part in helping employees <BR>
        complete jobs and progress in their careers. Learning more about business <br>
        technology and how it affects the workplace can help you better use what's <br>
        available in your workplace to your advantage. In this article, we review what <br>

<h2><ins>Types of Business & Technology</ins></h2>
<ol>
    <li><h3><ins>Computer Systems<ins></ins>:</h3>
        Computer systems are very useful pieces of technology that help support <br>
        almost all the others in a modern business system. It enables employees with <br>
        software tools that allow them to write letters, send emails, analyze records <br>
        and design presentations. Computers can be portable, allowing employees to <br>
        accomplish tasks even as they travel. A computer can help employees work <br>
        from home with software that gives them monitoring systems, cameras, work <br>
        tools and communication programs. Most people in a modern workplace use a <br>
        computer, even if they share it with other employees.
    </li>
    <li><h3><ins>Productivity Tools</ins>:</h3>
        Computer software and productivity tools help employees accomplish tasks <br>
        and stay focused on their work. These software tools allow employees to edit <br>
        documents, process code, arrange spreadsheets and complete instruction <br>
        forms. Some productivity tools help employees schedule their work, <br>
        suggesting when to work and when to take a short break.
    </li>
    <li><h3><ins>Mail and phone systems</ins>:</h3>
        Both mail and phone systems help employees communicate with one another <br>
        about daily tasks and projects. Businesses commonly use in-line phones that <br>
        only work on the company premises, although more modern establishments <br>
        may give leaders company administered cellphones. All phone systems in a <br>
        company usually have auto attendants that help callers find the employee <br>
        they want to reach. Work phone systems may also include custom voicemail <br>
        options as well, for when employees are away from work. Email systems work <br>
        similarly to company phone systems, usually being exclusive to the company <br>
        and sometimes only working on custom software. <a href="https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/what-is-business-technology" target="B/T">See More...</a>
