    <LI><b><ins>Computer Hardware</ins></b>: <br>
    is an umbrella term that refers to the physical components of a computer. Hardware includes tangible items which<br>
    can be physically touched or seen, and it is required for a computer to function. Computer hardware can be classified as internal or <br>
    external, which relates to the placement of the physical part in or around the device. Generally, internal hardware is required for <br>
    the computer to run, while external hardware enhances the use or functionality. Examples of internal computer hardware may include a video <br>
    card, memory, or a core processing unit (CPU), while external computer hardware examples include a keyboard or a computer case. <br>
    <b>What is the purpose of computer hardware?</b><br>
    Computer hardware is required for a computer to function. It is complimentary to software. Without either of these components,<br>
    a computer would not be able to operate.<br>
    Each piece of a computer has a specific purpose. For example, the central processing unit enables the computer to execute processes <br>
    through written code and software, whereas the internal disk drive is the primary source of storage for data and instructions on a computer. <a href="https://study.com/academy/lesson/what-is-computer-hardware-components-definition-examples.html#:~:text=Computer%20hardware%20is%20a%20general,and%20a%20hard%20disk%20drive." target="study.com">See More...</a></LI> <br>
    <li><b><ins>Computer software</ins></b>:</li>
    Software is a set of instructions, data or programs used to operate computers and execute <br>
    specific tasks. It is the opposite of hardware, which describes the physical aspects of a <br>
    computer. Software is a generic term used to refer to applications, <ins>scripts</ins> programs that <br>
    run on a device. It can be thought of as the variable part of a computer, while hardware is the <br>
    invariable part. <br>

    The two main categories of software are <ins>application</ins> software and <ins>system software</ins>. <br>
    An application is software that fulfills a specific need or performs tasks. System software is <br>
    designed to run a computer's hardware and provides a platform for applications to run on top of. <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchapparchitecture/definition/software" target="techtarget">See More...</a> <br>

    <li><b><ins>Network & Databases</ins></b>:
    A network database represents data in a graph-like structure, where pointers connect records in a network <br>
    or graph structure. In this model, data is organized into nodes (representing entities or records) and edges <br>
    (representing relationships between nodes). <br>
    Unlike the hierarchical model where a parent can have multiple children, but a child can only have one <br>
    parent, in a network database, nodes can have multiple connections to other nodes, enabling them to form <br>
    a more flexible and complex structure. This structure allows for more sophisticated relationships between <br>
    data entities, making it suitable for representing interconnected data. <a href="https://phoenixnap.com/glossary/network-database" target="phoenixnap">See More...</a> </li>
