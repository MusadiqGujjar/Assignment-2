    <h1><ins>Islamic Republic Of Pakistan</ins></h1>
    <p>
        Pakistan, officially the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, is a country in South Asia. <br>
        It is the fifth-most populous country, with a population of over 241.5 million, having the <br>
        second-largest Muslim population as of 2023. Islamabad is the nation's capital, while <br>
        Karachi is its largest city and financial centre. Pakistan is the 33rd-largest country by <br>
        area. Bounded by the Arabian Sea on the south, the Gulf of Oman on the southwest, <br>
        and the Sir Creek on the southeast, it shares land borders with India to the east; <br>
        Afghanistan to the west; Iran to the southwest; and China to the northeast. It shares <br>
        a maritime border with Oman in the Gulf of Oman, and is separated from Tajikistan in the <br>
        northwest by Afghanistan's narrow Wakhan Corridor. <br>
        Pakistan is the site of several ancient cultures, including the 8,500-year-old Neolithic <br>
        site of Mehrgarh in Balochistan, the Indus Valley Civilisation of the Bronze Age,[10] and <br>
        the ancient Gandhara civilisation.[11] The regions that compose the modern state of <br>
        Pakistan were the realm of multiple empires and dynasties, including the GandhƒÅra, the <br>
        Achaemenid, the Maurya, the Kushan, the Parthian, the Paratarajas, the Gupta;[12] the <br>
        Umayyad Caliphate in its southern regions, the Hindu Shahis, the Ghaznavids, the Delhi <br>
        Sultanate, the Samma, the Shah Miris, the Mughals,[13] the Durranis, the Sikhs and <br>
        most recently, the British Raj from 1858 to 1947.

    <h2><b><ins>Military</ins></b>:</h2>
    <p>The armed forces of Pakistan rank sixth globally in personnel size, with about 660,000 on active <br>
    duty and 291,000 paramilitary personnel as of 2024. Established in 1947, they've wielded <br>
    significant influence over national politics. The main branches include the Army, Navy, and Air <br>
    Force, supported by numerous paramilitaries. <br>
    The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC) is the highest-ranking military <br>
    officer, advising the civilian government. However, they lack direct command over the branches <br>
    and serve as intermediaries, ensuring communication between the military and civilian leadership. <br>
    Overseeing the Joint Staff Headquarters, they coordinate inter-service cooperation and joint <br>
    military missions.
    </p>
    <h2><b><ins>Economy</ins></b>:</h2>
    <p>
    Pakistan's economy ranks 24th globally by purchasing power parity (PPP) and 43rd <br>
    by nominal GDP. Historically, Pakistan was part of the wealthiest region in the first <br>
    millennium CE, but lost ground to regions like China and Western Europe by the 18th <br>
    century.[396] Pakistan is a developing country,[397] and part of the Next Eleven, poised <br>
    to become one of the world's largest economies in the 21st century, alongside the BRICS.
