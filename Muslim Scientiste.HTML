    <li><h2><b><ins>Ibn Al-Haytham<ins></ins></b>:</h2></li>
        Born around a thousand years ago in present day Iraq, Al-Hasan Ibn <br>
        al-Haytham (known in the West by the Latinised form of his <br>
        first name, initially “Alhacen” and later  “Alhazen”) was a pioneering <br>
        scientific thinker who made important contributions to the <br>
        understanding of vision, optics and light. His methodology of <br>
        investigation, in particular using experiment to verify theory, shows <br>
        certain similarities to what later became known as the modern <br>
        scientific method.  Through his Book of Optics (Kitab al-Manazir) <br>
        and its Latin translation (De Aspectibus), his ideas influenced <br>
        European scholars including those of the European Renaissance. <br>
        Today, many consider him a pivotal figure in the history of optics and <br>
        the “Father of modern Optics”. <br>
        <li>
        <h2><b><ins>Al-Battani</ins></b>:</h2>
        Born in 858 CE in the region of modern-day Turkey, Al-Battani, also known as <br>
        Albategnius, was a renowned Arab astronomer, astrologer, and <br>
        mathematician. His life was marked by the pursuit of knowledge, a trait that <br>
        was common in the Islamic Golden Age, a period characterized by <br>
        significant advancements in science, technology, and culture. <br>
        Al-Battani’s most significant work, “Kitab az-Zij” (“Book of Astronomical Tables”), <br>
        written around 900 CE, was a comprehensive treatise on astronomy and trigonometry <br>
        This book, which was based on Ptolemy’s “Almagest”, was not merely a translation <br>
        but an original work that included a range of new observations, corrections, <br>
        and innovations. It was one of the most influential books in astronomy and <br>
        trigonometry during the Middle Ages, and it was widely used in both the <br>
        Islamic world and Europe.

        <h2><b><ins>Al-Farabi</ins></b>:</h2>
        We know little that is really reliable about al-Fārābī’s life. Abū Naṣr al-Fārābī was probably born in <br>
        870 CE (AH 257) in a place called Farab or Farayb. In his youth he moved to Iraq and Baghdad. <br>
        In 943 CE (AH 331) he went to Syria and Damascus. He may have gone to Egypt but died in <br>
        Damascus in December 950 CE or January 951 CE (AH 339). Scholars have disputed his ethnic <br>
        origin. Some claimed he was Turkish but more recent research points to him being a Persian <br>
        (Rudolph 2017: 536–45). </li> 
        <ol>
        <b>Al-Fārābī had two main interests:</b>
        <li>Philosophy and logic in particular. Such interest explains why he is known as “the second <br>
        master” (the first one, of course, being Aristotle)</li>
        <li>Music. His huge Kitāb al-musiqā al-kabīr or Great Book of Music is the most important <br>
            medieval musical treatise in Islamic lands and also includes sophisticated philosophical <br>
            sections.
