        Tourism in Pakistan is a growing industry.[1] In 2010, Lonely Planet termed Pakistan "tourism's <br>
        'next big thing'". The country is geographically and ethnically diverse, and has a number of <br>
        historical and cultural heritage sites. Cond√© Nast Traveller ranked Pakistan The Best Holiday <br>
        Destination for 2020[2] and also declared it the third-highest potential adventure destination in <br>
        the world for 2020.[2] As security in the country improves, tourism increases; in two years, it has <br>
        increased by more than 300%
